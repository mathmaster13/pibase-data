The {S153} is a subspace of the {S38} by definition.
Thus the {S153} is a subspace of the compactification of the {S38}, which is the {S39}.

The {S153} contains neither end point of the {S39}.

Therefore, the quotient map from the {S39} to the {S196} is injective on the {S153}.

Thus the quotient map restricts to an embedding of the {S153} into the {S196}.

Thus the {S153} is homeomorphic to a subspace of the {S196}. But the {S153|P162}, which proves the desired result.
